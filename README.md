# ESP32 IoT Temp Sensor

ESP32 based wireless temperature sensor that sends data to a Firebase RTDB via a network. Temperature data is then accessed through a React based web app from any remote location. Motivation behind this project was to learn how to interface an ESP32 with cloud hosted databases for IoT applications.

ESP32 connected to DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor. Simple circuit but more sensors can be added later.
